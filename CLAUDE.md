# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a collection of random tools and utilities for daily use. Currently minimal, containing only a simple HTML page.

## Coding guidelines
 - The code that you write in this repository should be simple. HTML, JavaScript and CSS. No fancy framework. No React.

## Architecture

This repository is a flat structure with standalone tools and utilities. Each tool is self-contained with no dependencies between them.

## Viewing Tools

Since these are static HTML tools, open them directly in a browser:

```bash
open index.html
```

Or use a simple HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```
